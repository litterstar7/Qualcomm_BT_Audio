# This StrePlus scheme is following the one used for Stre.

# the possibility of one digital revision (dXX) being included in more
# than one chip spin (rXX).
# d00 digits are in r00 and do not include the ANC block
# v01 digits are in r00 and include the ANC block
# d01 digits are in r01 and do not include the ANC block
# v02 digits will be in r01 and include the ANC block
# At build time, our firmware cares about the difference between d00/v01 and
# d01v02, but not about the difference between r00 and r01.

# variant IDs). See <http://wiki/ChipVersionIDs>.
# It's not critical that it be correct, but it makes configcmd
# outputs filenames that are more likely to be what you want.
