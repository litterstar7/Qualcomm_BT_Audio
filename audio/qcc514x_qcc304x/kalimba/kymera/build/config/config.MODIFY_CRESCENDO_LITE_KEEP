# This code segment needs to be explicitly kept

# AAC is not part of the lite ROM image so if this code
# segment is not kept it would be garbage collected and won't
# show up in the ROM. See B-257584, dg 10810589 for details.

#For ROM Lite configuration - Wrapper, lib and data tables are downloaded, data tables art part of RAM.
#Later these data tables are mapped to variables instead of coping from ROM which is the desired behaviour for normal ROM congiguration builds.
#To accomplish this moved AACDEC_TABLE_NO_FLASH_COPY from config.MODIFY_DOWANLOAD_AAC which affects all ROM configurations.
#Below deifine only applicable ROM Lite configurations.
