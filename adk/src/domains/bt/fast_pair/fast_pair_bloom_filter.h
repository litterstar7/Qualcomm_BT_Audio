      Account key filter or Bloom filter is used in adverts in unidentifiable or BR/EDR non-discoverable mode only.
      
      The following are the trigger to generate bloom filter
      - During fastpair advertising init, to be ready with the data
      - During addition of new account key
      - During Adv Mgr callback to get Item, this is to ensure new bloom filter is ready with a new Salt.
      - Deletion of account keys is taken care through the session data API
      - Internal timer expiry to track Salt change in Account key Filter  
      - Receipt of new battery status information from the case
