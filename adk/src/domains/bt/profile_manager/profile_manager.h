\brief     Interface of the profile manager module.

    These apis are used by application to register different profile connection
    handlers with the profile manager as well as invoking them when application
    wants to connect all supported profiles for that device.Profile manager will
    handle connection crossover as well as is able to connect profiles in any order
    application wants.
