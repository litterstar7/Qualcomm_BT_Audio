\brief      Public interface to mirror ACL & eSCO connections.

This module manages the mirror connections used in TWM devices.

It is responsible for:

* Creating and managing the mirror ACL / eSCO / A2DP connection., e.g.
    dealing with link-loss of the mirror connection(s).
* Only actively creating mirror links when a peer earbud and a handset
    are connected.
* Acting in either a Primary or Secondary role. e.g. only the Primary can
    actively connect or disconnect a mirror connection.
* Interfacing with the voice/audio sources which will create the necessary SCO or
    A2DP audio chains to render a mirrored eSCO or A2DP link.
* Notifying registered modules about the state of the mirror links.
* Taking part in the handover process by:
  * Being able to veto it.
  * Making the mirror eSCO or A2DP Sink available to the handover process so
    it can be moved into a 'real' HFP or A2DP profile instance and vice-versa.

In a mirror ACL / eSCO / A2DP connection there is always a Primary device
and a Secondary device. This module puts all the responsibility for connecting
/ disconnecting and managing the lifetime of the connection on the Primary
device.

As an example, if there is a link-loss scenario both Primary & Secondary will
receive a MDM_LINK_DISCONNECT_IND with a link-loss reason. But then the
behaviour is different:

Primary:
* Actively try to re-connect the mirror connection(s)

Secondary:
* Do nothing until it receives notification of a successful mirror connection.

The mirror_profile module listens to notifications from other bluetooth profile
modules in order to know when to create the mirror connection(s).

Both mirror eSCO (HFP) and A2DP connections first require a mirror ACL
connection to be created.

The mirror eSCO connection is created when the handset HFP SCO channel is
created. Usually this will be when a call is incoming or outgoing.

The mirror A2DP is created when the A2DP media starts to stream.

Dependencies
To create a mirror ACL connection there must be:
* An ACL connection to the Handset.
* An ACL connection to the peer earbud.

To create a mirror eSCO connection there must be:
* A mirror ACL connection.
* A HFP SCO connection to the Handset.

To create a mirror A2DP connection there must be:
* A mirror ACL connection
* An A2DP media connection to the Handset (the module only mirrors the A2DP media
  channel L2CAP channel).

The handset must be master of the ACL connection to the primary earbud.
The link policy module sets the handset link policy. Mirror profile manages the
peer earbud link policy.

The Bluetooth firmware automatically disconnects mirror links when the
dependencies (above) are not met, e.g. on link loss. Therefore the mirror profile
does not typically initiate mirror link disconnection.

A2DP mirroring start sequence is shown below. The mirror L2CAP and the audio
chains on both devices are started before the media stream from the handset is
accepted.
@startuml
Handset -> Primary : Unsniff (if previously idle)
Handset -> Primary : AVDTP Start Command
Primary <-> Secondary : Unsniff
Primary -> Secondary : Mirror L2CAP request
Secondary -> Primary : Mirror L2CAP response
Primary <-> Secondary : Sniff
Secondary -> Secondary : Start A2DP audio chain
Primary -> Primary : Start A2DP audio chain
Primary <-> Secondary : Mirror L2CAP confirm
Primary -> Handset : AVDTP Start Response
