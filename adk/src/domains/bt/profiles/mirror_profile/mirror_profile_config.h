/*! Delay to use on the Primary between a failed mirror ACL connect req and
    trying the mirror ACL connect req again.

    Most reasons for a mirror ACL connect req to fail will require indefinite
    retries. e.g. connection timeout (link-loss).

    It is recommended to keep this delay large enough to avoid flooding the
    firmware with mirror ACL requests.

/*! This is the length of time after eSCO/A2DP mirroring stops before the link
    policy is set to a lower power (and higher latency) setting. */

/*! The time to wait for QHS link to establish between buds before starting
    mirroring. Mirroring will be started before this timeout if QHS is
    established  */

/*! The time to wait with the peer link in active mode after connecting to
    the peer before placing the link into sniff mode if the profile remains idle.

/*! When TELEPHONY_CALL_ONGOING is received, the primary earbud brings the
    link with the secondary to active mode, this reduces the time taken to
    start eSCO mirroring. In some corner cases, TELEPHONY_CALL_ONGOING is
    received but the eSCO never connects. This configuration defines the maximum
    time to wait for the eSCO to connect before putting the link back into sniff
    mode. */
