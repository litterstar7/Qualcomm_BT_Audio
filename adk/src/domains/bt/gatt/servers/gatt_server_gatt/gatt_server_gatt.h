    If GATT services have changed on the local device,

    to inform any interested bonded clients of this.
    Clients can use the client configuration of the Service Changed
    characteristic to register for indications of such changes.
    This API will send indications to any connected clients that have
    registered and are bonded.

    for given CID for a handset device.

    This is an workaround fix for DFU from a old version to new version when
    GATT DB has been modified. Send notification to connected handset device by
    invoking appDeviceSetGattServerServicesChanged
