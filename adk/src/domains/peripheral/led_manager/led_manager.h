\brief      Header file for the LED Manager

This file provides functionality for controlling LED flashes.

The LED flashing code supports the concept of priority levels where a
given priority can be assigne to each pattern so that a higher priority
LED indication can interrupt a lower priority one. By default the code
supports up to four LED priority levels.

This code also allows LED filters to be defined. When using these an
application author can define that on a certain condition (for example
low battery state) all LED indications are displayed using the red LED
rather than the blue one.
