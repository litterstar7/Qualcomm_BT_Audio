\brief      UI domain/component

    A note on terminology:

    Concept             | Definition
    ------------------- | -------------
    Logical Input       | A Logical Input is defined as a physical signal being asserted for a specific duration. E.g. PIO 1 is asserted for 1 second could be Logical Input 1, PIO 1 asserted for 3 seconds could then be Logical Input 2.
    UI Event            | A UI Event is an internal event representing a transient indication that needs to be provided to the User in a one-shot fashion. UI Events are raised by UI Indicators when some audio or visual indication is configured to occur when a specified system event is observed. For example: consider the case where the battery voltage goes below some configured threshold, this could result in an audio prompt indication to the user; "battery low".
    UI Input            | The UI Input is an internal event that may get generated following an occurrence of a logical input. Some example UI Inputs: "End Call", "Power On", "Volume Up". Where a UI Input is raised following a Logical Input, only one UI Input can be raised. I.e. there is a 1:1 relationship between Logical Inputs and UI Inputs, not a 1:N relationship. This is to simplify use cases and to prevent unintended consequences when configuring the Application UI.
    UI Provider         | A UI Provider is a component that provides contextual information about the state of the product that the user needs in order to be able to operate it. This contextual information is a vital part of the complete UI of the device. Example UI Providers are the Media Player and Telephony services.
    UI Provider Context | This is the actual contextual/state information that a specific UI Provider issues. E.g. for the Telephony service, possible contexts would be "Ringing", "In Call" etc.
    UI Indicator        | A UI Indicator is some part of the system that indicates status or feedback information to the User. For example this could be a Display, LEDs or Audio indications such as Tones and Prompts.

    These APIs are used by the Application, alongside UI Providers, UI Input
    Consumers and UI Provider Context Consumers to register/unregister themselves
    with the UI component and to handling incoming Logical Inputs.

    This module raises UI Inputs in response to Logical Input stimuli, according to
    the UI configuration. These UI Inputs are forwarded to all interested UI Input
    Consumers.

    This API is called by the various UI Providers in the system to register their

    These get context callbacks are used by the UI module to query a UI Providers
    current context whenever a Logical Input to the system is detected. The UI module
    looks up the Logical Input and the UI Provider Context in its configuration table
    and determines if a UI Input should be raised. The UI Input can then be issued to

    This API is called by modules who want to subscribe for notifications about

    shall be sent to the registered Task handler.

    matching UI Provider context had been found.

    The delay period may be required to support use cases where an event needs
    to be sent to a peer device and handled at the same time on both peers.
    Configuring the delay period allows the event to be raised at the same
    instant on both peers.

    \param ui_input - The UI Input to be injected

    due to the time needed to propagate the event to the peer - this is the purpose
    of the return type - to provide the ammended time_to_play back to the originating
    UI Indicator.
