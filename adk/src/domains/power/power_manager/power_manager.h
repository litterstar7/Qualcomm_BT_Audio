\brief	    Header file for the Power Management.

The power manager monitors charger status, battery level and temperature.
It also maintains two lists of clients. One list is for clients interested in going to sleep,
the other is clients interested in powering down.
When clients register they will be notified before the system go to sleep or power off.
Clients must respond, otherwise power manager will be waiting forever.

Power off can be requested or being triggered by critical battery voltage level or temperature.
Sleep is triggered when all registered clients will allow sleeping.

Both above transitions are conditional to charger being in known state and not charging.
