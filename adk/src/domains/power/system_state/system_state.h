\defgroup   system_state System State
\brief      Executes transitions between power states.

On itself system state doesn't call any components including power related.
It is also not deciding when to change a state.

System state defines handful of states and allows for registration of functions to be executed
on transition between states.

System state is not deciding when to change a state it must be told to change a state.
It notifies clients when the state change occurs.

System state enforces which state can transition to which state with exception of Emergency Shutdown,
to which system can transition from any other state.

To address varying needs of different applications it is possible to remove Limbo state.
See SystemState_RemoveLimboState.

There are two types of sates stable and transitional.
E.g. system_state_initialisation is transitional state,
whereas system_state_initialised is stable state.
See functions starting transitions like SystemState_Initialise().

Initial state is system_state_powered_off.

/*! \brief Transition step function prototype.

    An step function can be synchronous or asynchronous.

    Synchronous step functions must return either TRUE or FALSE,
    depending on whether they were successful.

    Asynchronous step functions should return TRUE if the
    step is in progress.

    When the step completes this should be signalled to the system_state
    module by sending the expected message to the #step_task passed into the
    #step_function. The message may optionally contain data, e.g. a success or
    fail code, in which case a #step_handler for the message can be used to
    check if the initialisation was successful.

    Asynchronous step functions may return FALSE if the
    initialisation fails before it reaches the asynchronous part.

    \param step_task Task to send the expected completion message to when
                     an asynchronous step has finished. Synchronous step
                     functions do not use this.

    \return TRUE if step was successful or is in progress,
            FALSE otherwise.

/*! \brief Asynchronous step complete handler prototype.

    If an asynchronous step function returns a message with a payload,
    for example a success code, then the user module can use a function
    of this type to process the contents of the payload and tell the
    system_state module if the initialisation was successful or not.

    \param message [in] Message payload of the step complete message.

    \return TRUE if the step was successful, FALSE otherwise.
