\brief      This component records the time at which events occur and calculates
            the time difference between two events.

            A one milli-second time resolution is used. The timestamps are stored
            internally in 16-bit variables resulting in a maximum time difference
            between two events of 65535ms.

            The module is used for measurning KPIs on-chip during tests and can
            be removed from production software by defining DISABLE_TIMESTAMP_EVENT.
