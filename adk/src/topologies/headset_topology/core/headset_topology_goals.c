/*! \brief This table defines each goal supported by the topology.

    Each entry links the goal set by a topology rule decision with the procedure required to achieve it.

    Entries also provide the configuration for how the goal should be handled, identifying the following
    characteristics:
     - is the goal exclusive with another, requiring the exclusive goal to be cancelled
     - the contention policy of the goal
        - can cancel other goals
        - can execute concurrently with other goals
        - must wait for other goal completion
     - function pointers to the procedure or script to achieve the goal
     - events to generate back into the role rules engine following goal completion
        - success, failure or timeout are supported
     
    Not all goals require configuration of all parameters so utility macros are used to define a
    goal and set default parameters for unrequired fields.
