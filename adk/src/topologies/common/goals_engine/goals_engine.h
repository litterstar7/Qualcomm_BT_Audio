\brief      Module for managing running and contention between topology goals.

This module provides a generic goal engine that allows a topology to define its
own specific goals and the various parameters that control how and when they
will be run and which procedure they trigger.

Typically a topology shall define its goal ids in an enum and the properties
for each goal id will be defined in a goal table - one entry per goal id.
These are passed in to #GoalsEngine_CreateGoalSet to create an instance of a
goal_set_t.

Once a goal_set_t instance has been created the topology can activate a Goal
and the goals engine will run the Procedure associated with the Goal based on
whether other gGals are running, if the new Goal can run concurrently with
them, or if it needs to be marked as pending and held in an internal queue.


Goal Table

The entries in the goal table have various properties - some are required and
some are optional. This header defines a number of macros to simplify defining
the entries in the goal table based on how they are intended to be run. For an
example see the #GOAL or #GOAL_SUCCESS and related macros.


Goal Properties

An entry in the goal table can have the following properties:

* A unique goal_id
* A contention action that defines how the Goal is processed if it is activated
  while other Goal(s) are already active.
* An optional list of Goal(s) that can run concurrently with this Goal.
* An associated Procedure, or Scripted Procedure, that is started when the Goal
  is run.
* An optional Rule event that is generated when the Procedure started by the
  Goal completes.
** Different Rule events can be generated for success, fail or timeout.


\par Interaction Betwen Rules, Goals and Procedures.

A Goal is activated when a Rule makes a decision to run that Goal. The Rule
decision can optionally include a custom data payload which the goals engine
passes on to its associated Procedure when the Goal is run.

The topology defines its own Rules, Goals and Procedures but uses the common
rules, goals and scripting engines to handle the logic of how they are
processed.

In practice some of the knowledge of how the Rules, Goals and Procedures
interact is known only to the topology itself. For example, the contents of the
optional Rule decision payload is known only by the topology itself.

Because of this the topology still needs to implement some "glue" operations.
For example, to pass on Rule decisions to the Goal set the topology must
convert between the MessageId of the Rule decision and the goal_id it
represents.

Another example is when a Procedure completes and a Goal generates a new Rule
event. The topology must pass the new Rule event to the currently running Rule
set.
