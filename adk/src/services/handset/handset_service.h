\defgroup   handset_service Handset Service
\ingroup    services
\brief      A service that provides procedures for connecting and managing
            connections to handset(s).

# Overview

This service is mainly concerned with managing the connection to a handset.
That includes both remote (initiated by the handset) and local (initiated by a
call to one of the connect APIs) connections.

## Remote Connections

Remote connections will be detected by this handset service and notified to
any clients that have registered for notifications.

For the handset to initiate a connection the local device must first be
connectable - there are functions in this service to control whether the local
device is connectable or not.

## Local Connections

There are functions to request the connection or disconnection of a handset and
these also include the list of profiles to connect to the handset. This service
will manage the connect or disconnect procedure until it is completed. When it
is complete the client Task that made the request will be sent a matching CFM
message containing the result.

Both connect and disconnect procedures can be cancelled while they are still in
progress by making the opposite request. For example, connect will be cancelled
if a disconnect request is made while it is progress, and vice versa for
disconnect.

## Connection Status

If the connection status changes for any reason, e.g. link-loss or the handset
has initiated a disconnect, it will be notified to any clients that have
registered for notifications.
