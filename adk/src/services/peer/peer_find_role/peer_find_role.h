/*! \defgroup   peer_find_role Peer Find Role Service (LE)

    The peer find role service is responsible for finding a peer device, 
    and determining the roles each device should take  based on the state 
    of the devices.

    The service is started by a call to PeerFindRole_FindRole(). 
    The service then continues until a peer device is detected and a role 
    selected. A timeout can be supplied in the initial call to 
    PeerFindRole_FindRole(). When this timeout expires a 
    #PEER_FIND_ROLE_ACTING_PRIMARY message is sent to the 
    registered tasks, but the service continues looking for a role.

    The service operates by scanning for devices and also advertising its
    presence, normally simultaneously. Exceptions to this are
    \li After a connection failure the start of advertising is delayed.
        If the failure was caused by the two devices connecting to each
        other at the same time, this should ensure that only one is
        advertising initially.
    \li If a device is busy with media, either music or a telephone call
        then the device will not scan. This means that if both devices 
        are busy, perhaps connected to different devices, they will not 
        be able to connect to each other until one stops.

    Once devices are discovered and a connection made, the role is
    determined by comparison of a figure of merit provided by the GATT 
    role selection service. This allows a decision to be made and one
    device is told to assume the primary role with the message
    #PEER_FIND_ROLE_PRIMARY, while the other will be told
    #PEER_FIND_ROLE_SECONDARY.

    \note After sending a #PEER_FIND_ROLE_PRIMARY message, the find role
    procedure will continue, advertising only. This will be stopped by
    either a call to PeerFindRole_FindRoleCancel() or 
    PeerFindRole_FindRole().

    For more comprehensive details of the implementation look at the state 
    machine documentation below (state transitions).

    As part of the implementation internal messages are sometimes sent
    delayed, offering the chance for them to be cancelled, or using condition
    flags so that messages are sent when all activities blocking them
    have finished. See the media_busy element of peerFindRoleTaskData as
    an example.
