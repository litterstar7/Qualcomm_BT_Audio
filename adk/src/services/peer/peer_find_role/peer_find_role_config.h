/*! Time after which advertising will be started when starting find role

    A backoff is applied when a connection for find role fails. This
    is effectively the initial backoff.

    This is specified in milliseconds

/*! Time after which to disconnect the find role link from the server side

    A timeout is needed here to reduce the risk of one device determining
    a role, while the other side does not get the opposite role.

    A long timeout will block the server device from changing its 
    Bluetooth address as it is required there are no active links.

/*! Time after which the server will stop waiting for the client role selection indication

    A timeout is needed here to workaround the case when the server is waiting
    for the client to inform it of the result of the role selection, but for
    whatever reason the client indication never arrives.

    to catch corner cases where the peer earbud stops advertising after this
    earbud has discovered it - e.g. it is put in case or powers off.

/*! Time delay to allow scanning after an activity finishes.

    Scanning is blocked by activities that use Bluetooth bandwidth, although
    advertising will still happen.

    When the activity stops, a short delay is recommended as another
    activity could start - for instance a call disconnecting and music
    restarting.

    will not get one. If we reach this timeout we go and ask for the
    characteristic value
