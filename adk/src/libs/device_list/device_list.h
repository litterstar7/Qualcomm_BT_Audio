    This function is similar to DeviceList_GetFirstDeviceWithPropertyValue, but it returns an array 
    of device handles for all the devices which have the matching property value.

    This function will allocate a buffer of memory to return the device_array. It is the callers
    responsibility to free this buffer when it has used the device handles. The buffer is a copy of the
    device handles in the DeviceList, the list is unaffected when the returned device array is free'd.

    \param id Property to match on a device.
    \param value Pointer to the value of the property to match.
    \param size Size of the property value.
    \param [out] device_array A pointer to the device array of the devices which match the specified property value.
    \param [out] len_device_array A pointer to the size of the device array.
