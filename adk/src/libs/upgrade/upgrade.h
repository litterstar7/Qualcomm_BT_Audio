@file   upgrade.h
@brief  Header file for the Upgrade library

        Interface to the Upgrade library which provides support for upgrading
        CSR device software, using the VM Upgrade mechanism.

        The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message
        based API.

        See @ref otau_library

@page   otau_library Upgrade library integration

This page provides a summary of how the upgrade library upgrade.h
integrates with applications.

@section sec_basic Basics

To make use of the upgrade library, all of the following are needed.

Examples of all of these can be found in the example Sink application
supplied with the ADK. See @ref sec_sinkapp for a summary of the upgrade
library integration.
        @li @ref subsec_defparset
        @li @ref subsec_tranmech
        @li @ref subsec_libinit
        @li @ref subsec_libint
        @li @ref subsec_permit
        @li @ref subsec_host

@subsection subsec_defparset Partition set

The library uses the concept of logical partitions to define what is being
upgraded. Apart from a partition used for DFU operations these must be
paired, such that there is an active partition and a partition available for
upgrade.

The unused partitions will be kept erased.

@subsection subsec_tranmech Transport mechanism
@subsection subsec_libinit Library initialisation
@subsection subsec_libint Library integration
@subsection subsec_permit Permitting activities
@subsection subsec_host A host applications

@section sec_sinkapp Supplied Sink application

The Sink application supplied as an example makes use of the upgrade
library through the gaia library (gaia.h).

    of permission as required.

    The upgrade library may reject an attempt by the VM application to disable

    * Rebooting the device as part of completing an upgrade
    * Blocking the system to erase serial flash partition, may effect audio.
