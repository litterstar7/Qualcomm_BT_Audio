 * Status of L2CAP mirroring is indicated using MDM_L2CAP_CREATE_CFM
 *  
 * When reliable ACL sniffing is enabled, the mirror L2CAP processes L2CAP
 * packets sent by the remote device to the primary device on the mirrored 
 * L2CAP channel. Processed L2CAP packets are sent to the associated mirror 
 * L2CAP stream. The application can access the mirrored L2CAP packets via
 * the mirror L2CAP stream.
 * 
 * L2CAP mirroring is completely driven by Primary device just like ACL and eSCO
 * mirroring. 
 *
 * Note: 
 *   1. L2CAP mirroring doesn't guarantee reliable L2CAP data sniffing, 
 *      Secondary device can miss one or more L2CAP packets sent by remote 
 *      device to Primary device.
