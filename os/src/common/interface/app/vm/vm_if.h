        vm_if.h  -  VM Interface

CONTAINS
        Interface elements between the VM and VM Applications, that are
        not in sys.[ch]

DESCRIPTION
        This file is seen by the stack, and VM applications, and
        contains event numbers that are common between them.

        Events can be read (and cleared) using EventCounter. If they are
        enabled, using EventEnable, then that event can also cause VmWait
        to return before the specified timeout.

    @brief Enumerated type representing run time profiles to use with
           VmRequestRunTimeProfile() and VmGetRunTimeProfile() on supported
           chips.
        The profile affects the application subsystem only and does not reconfigure 
        other blocks of the system such as the radio link or sleep.
        Note that all profiles might not be available on all products. 
        However a profile can still be requested.     
    @sa VmRequestRunTimeProfile(), VmGetRunTimeProfile()
    @sa Other functions that can affect overall power consumption such as 
        VmDeepSleepEnable(), VmTransmitPowerSetMaximum(), etc.

        lower latency app execution or time critical code execution not met by 
        the \c VM_POWER_SAVING and \c VM_BALANCED profiles. It comes at the 
        expense of power consumption. This profile is usually applied immediately.
